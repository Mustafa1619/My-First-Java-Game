# My First Java Game Demo
## In this project, I wanted to test my Java knowledge. Although it is not a visually convenient game, I made a short game where you will spend 5 minutes with simple gameplay. It is open to development. For example, a few more venues and monsters can be added, some games can be placed in it. Looking at the game design and display features more harmonious background, object and sound effects can be added. game scenario can be written and the game can be created from certain levels and chapters. All audio files and object pictures taken from internet. Musics can changed. I put it in my favorite game's music. I can even have a copyright penalty, maybe :P

In here, you must find the candle to enter the cave. Check the bush behind the tree. If you cant find it, I cant do anything about that. But you can do. Keep searching.
